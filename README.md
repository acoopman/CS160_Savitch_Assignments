# CS160_Savitch_Assignments

I took CS160 at Front Range Collage and here are the assignments that was for homework.               
The format is lesson(lesson#)-(page#)-(problem#)                                  
For a good template that shows all the features off c++ look at lesson 11 and the VectorDouble class
